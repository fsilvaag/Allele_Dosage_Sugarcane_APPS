Within this folder we can find the supporting information for the paper "Sequencing vs amplification for the estimation of allele dosages in sugarcane (Saccharum spp.)".

1. Appendix S1: Composition of the Cenicaña’s diverse panel of 220 genotypes, with some representing the genetic diversity of Cenicaña’s germplasm bank, wild species, resistant or susceptible to different pests and diseases in Colombia, and of relevance for the breeding program.
2. Appendix S2: Adjacent window of 400 bp (200 bp upstream and 200 bp downstream) used for probe design in Flex-Seq and KASP technologies for the 76 SNPs selected. The SNP is located at position 201 and denoted within a squared bracket.
3. Appendix S3: Pearson correlation between GBS+RADSeq, Flex-Seq Ex-L®, and KASPTM in 53 genotypes of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) and 76 SNP markers. The analysis includes the correlation coefficient, the t-statistic (t), the degrees of freedom (df), and the p value (P) for each marker. Empty cell for correlation indicates the marker was not converted to KASPTM.
